            <h2>Hello!üëã</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my site. I'm Lester, I graduated from <a href="https://www.pup.edu.ph/">Polytechnic University of the
                Philippines</a>  in 2019 with a degree in Diploma in Computer Engineering Technology. In the
                past few years I have worked on many independent projects alongside my formal education. My goal is to
                develop innovative solutions in Tech industries through my combined software and hardware experience.
                I have advanced knowledge in Python and C, experience designing custom electronic
                circuits/microcontrollers,
                as well as building this website using responsive web technologies.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do you blog?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
            <p>
                Mostly for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of software development over time ‚Äì whatever I
                am thinking about or working on. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a
                public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, 
                relevant, or interesting. I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome email and comments ‚Äì as long as
                they're on topic, more or less.
            </p>
